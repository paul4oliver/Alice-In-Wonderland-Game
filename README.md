It is Frabjous day and you have just stumbled down the rabbit hole into the curious place known as Underland, or shall we say “Wonderland”. Unbeknownst to you, the Red Queen, Iracebeth of Crimms, has deceitfully taken rule over the land with a cruel, and heavy hand. Your friend Hatter, the Mad Hatter, has been taken prisoner, hatless. You have been tasked with the mission of defeating the Red Queen’s most ferocious and destructive monster, the Jabberwocky, to save all of Underland and restore rightful power to the White Queen, Mirana of Marmoreal! Before you can take down the winged beast, you must traverse through Underland and collect items to aid your quest. 

You begin at Long Hall, the room of doors and entrance to Underland.  Before you meet the villainous Jabberwocky in Tugley Woods where it lives, you must gather:

Mad Hatter’s Hat – Hatter is nothing without his hat and he has lost his muchness! Find the hat at the Tea Party table at Hatter’s House and take it with you for you will be able to give it back to Hatter after taking down the Jabberwocky. 

Golden Key – In order to enter the garden, you must first find the Golden Key that unlocks the door to the beautiful beds of flowers and cool fountains. You will find it in White Rabbit’s house.

Oraculum – It tells of each and every day since the beginning. It looks similar to a map and is with the White Queen in Marmoreal. You will need it to help guide your journey. You must be in the right place at the right time. 

Vorpal Sword – a magical weapon that cannot be damaged. It is the only weapon powerful enough to take down the Jabberwocky and is being hidden away in Crimms. Journey there to locate it for you will need it but go stealthily.

Mushroom of Life – Not your normal mushroom! Taking a bite of one side will make you grow taller and taking a bite of the other will make you grow smaller. A useful tool in an uncommon land. Absolem, the caterpillar, holds this item in The Garden. 

Turtle Shell – A gift from the Mock Turtle. It will let you swim underwater for an unusual amount of time! It will be waiting for you at Dry Landing.
